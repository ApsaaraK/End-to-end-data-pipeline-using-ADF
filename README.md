### 1. Project Overview
   
This project demonstrates the creation of an end-to-end data pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to process COVID-19 data. The primary objective is to support predictive modeling and trend analysis through automated data ingestion and transformation workflows.

### 2. Goals and Use Cases
   
Goals
- Automate COVID-19 data collection and processing.
- Provide real-time insights into hospital occupancy and mortality trends.
- Enable public health officials to monitor the pandemic and make data-driven decisions.

Use Cases
- Predict ICU occupancy to ensure adequate medical resources.
- Analyze testing positivity rates to detect early surges and trigger interventions.

### 3. Technologies Used
- Azure Data Factory (ADF): Workflow orchestration and automation.
- Azure Blob Storage: Raw data storage from external sources.
- Azure Data Lake Gen2: Intermediate and transformed data storage.
- Azure SQL Database: Queryable structured storage for analysis.
- Azure Databricks: Data transformation and machine learning.
- Power BI: Visualization of COVID-19 trends and analytics.

### 4. Data Sources
   
- ECDC Website: Provides COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing data.
- URL: [ECDC COVID-19 Data](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data)

Eurostat
Supplies demographic data (population by age group) to enhance predictive modeling.
URL: [Eurostat Population Data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)

### 5. Architecture Diagram
   
Below is the Architecture Diagram representing the flow of data between the different Azure components:
- Ingestion: Pulls data from external sources such as ECDC API and Eurostat.
- Transformation: Processes data using Azure Databricks and ADF Data Flows.
- Storage: Stores data in Azure Data Lake Gen2 and SQL Database for further processing.
- Orchestration & Monitoring: Manages and monitors workflows through Azure Data Factory pipelines.
- Visualization: Power BI dashboards visualize trends and predictions based on processed data.

#### Explanation of Architecture Diagram<br>

Please take a look at the attached ### Solution_Architecture_Diagram.svg for more detailed descriptions of individual components and configurations.<br>

Key points include:
- Azure Blob Storage: Stores raw COVID-19 and population data.
- Azure Data Lake Gen2: Serves as the main data repository after processing.
- SQL Database: Aggregates structured data for analytics and reporting.
- Data Pipelines: Use ADF to automate data ingestion, transformation, and storage workflows.
- Monitoring and CI/CD Integration: Explained in sections Orchestration and Monitoring and CI/CD Implementation.

### 6. Process Flow
   
1. Data Ingestion <br>
ADF Pipelines pull data from ECDC API and Eurostat.<br>
Data is stored in Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2.

2. Data Transformation<br>
Use Databricks clusters for cleaning, aggregation, and transformations.<br>
Prepare data for machine learning models and reporting.

3. Data Storage<br>
Store transformed data in SQL Database for fast querying.<br>
Intermediate and raw data are stored in Data Lake Gen2.

4. Orchestration and Monitoring<br>
Use ADF triggers to schedule pipelines and automate tasks.<br>
Monitor pipeline execution through ADF Monitoring and Azure Monitor.

5. Reporting<br>
Build Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.<br>

### 7. Orchestration and Pipelines
   
- Population Data Pipeline<br>
    - Ingests population data from Blob Storage to Data Lake Gen2

- COVID-19 Data Pipeline<br>
    - Retrieves daily COVID-19 case, death, and testing data from ECDC

- SQL Copy Pipeline<br>
    - Copies aggregated data from Data Lake Gen2 to SQL Database.

### 8. Security Considerations
   
- Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Enforces access restrictions to resources.
- Encryption: Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Managed Identities: Eliminates the need for storing credentials.
- Network Security: Private endpoints secure communication between services.

### 9. Monitoring and Alerts
    
- Azure Monitor: Tracks pipeline health and sends alerts for failures or delays.
- Built-in ADF Monitoring: Logs pipeline runs and allows for re-runs in case of errors.
- Power BI Monitoring Dashboard: Visualizes pipeline execution metrics.

### 10. CI/CD Implementation
    
The project follows a CI/CD pipeline managed through Azure DevOps
- Development Branch: Developers create feature branches for changes.
- Testing Branch: Changes are tested in a staging environment.
- Production Deployment: Approved changes are deployed to production via ARM templates.

### 11. Performance Benchmarks
    
Pipeline Execution Time: Average time to process and transform data.<br>
- Data Volume: Daily ingestion of COVID-19 data (~X GB).
- Dashboard Refresh Rate: Updated every X hours with new data.

### 12. Challenges and Solutions
    
- Dynamic Data Formats: ECDC switched from daily to weekly reports, requiring metadata-driven pipelines.
- Error Handling: Implemented automatic retries for failed activities.
- Performance Optimization: Partitioned data in Data Lake Gen2 to improve query speeds.

### 13. Future Enhancements
    
- Incorporate Vaccination Data: Add vaccination datasets to the pipeline.
- Expand Reporting: Build regional analysis dashboards in Power BI.
- Advanced Analytics: Use Azure Machine Learning to forecast future pandemic trends.

### 14. Business Impact
    
- Reduced Manual Effort: Automated workflows replaced manual data collection.
- Improved Decision-Making: Accurate insights led to better public health policies.
- Scalable Solution: The architecture supports additional datasets and new use cases.
